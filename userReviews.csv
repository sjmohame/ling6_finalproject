The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272425/,"It has been ten years since ""The Little Mermaid"" was released.  Back when Disney originally released the film, I was both excited and apprehensive. Excited, because it is one of the best children's stories and one of my favorites.  Apprehensive, because I knew Disney would change the ending and give it a happy ending, which is understandable but still unfortunate. When I first saw it, I liked it much more than I thought I would, and after each repeated viewing, I have liked it more and more.  I am now convinced this is the second best American Animated film, after ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The music, story, writing, and animation are superb as others have stated, but the villainess, Ursula, is also a major factor in the success of the film. She is the best written and performed of all Disney villains.  She is purely evil but totally believable.  Pat Carroll, who I have often noticed but never really considered, did a fabulous job with Ursula's characterization. The music and songs are consistantly very good.  There is no deep thought to this one, but ""The Little Mermaid"" is artfully near-perfect entainment."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272397/,"Ariel is a fiery, independent teenage mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She literally makes a deal with the devil to get her man. I love how sweet Ariel is with Eric, especially when she can't talk! Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder are all very funny, the animation, voice-overs and music are incredible! Who can resist the urge to sing and dance to ""Under The Sea""? A fun, enjoyable movie that the whole family will love and treasure."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2359853/,"'The Little Mermaid' brought back Disney firmly into the map after a period of crisis and less successful movies, even if not all of them were that bad. For instance, 'The Fox and the Hound' and 'The Great Mouse Detective' are not bad. The horrifying 'The Black Cauldron' and the frankly poor 'Oliver & Company' belong to a dark age at Disney, though, and were made during that period.'The Little Mermaid' came precisely after 'Oliver & Company'. And what a difference comparing to that one! You can say that Disney went from one extreme to another. That is, from a deplorable and very cheap-looking movie they went to this which happens to be one of their finest.This film is fresh, lively, charming, humorous, romantic and artistic. It has beautiful artwork and colors, made to a quality level comparable to 'The Rescuers'. Besides, it isn't just a movie about merpeople, it has a story. And it isn't too girly. The idea of a movie about merpeople might sound too feminine for males's tastes, but men and women can be pleased with it in the same way. Take it from me.Since I was a child this has been one of Disney's best to me. And yet somehow it seems to improve with time. My explanation to this is that it ages better than you might think at some point in your life.The soundtrack is always nice, but variable in genre and temperament. There are jolly songs (""Under the Sea"" and ""Les Poissons""), a love song (""Kiss the Girl""), a song of hope, anxiety, dreams and optimism (""Part of your world"") and a dark-spirited song (""Poor Unfortunate Souls"").Ursula is one of Disney's big villains. Strangely she was never scary to me as a kid and I even used to find her funny, particularly when she puts lipstick and the kiss she simulates next. Also, her figure used to amuse me: half fat woman, half octopus. Now as an adult, she doesn't scare me but I can see how pure evil she is and I've gotta admit that there are some pretty disturbing and creepy scenes with her.Scuttle is hilarious. He's a self-claimed ""expert"" on human stuff and makes up funny names for objects (in his language, a fork is a ""dinglehopper"" and he says people use it to comb their hair; a pipe is a ""snarfblatt"" and he tells people use it to play music like a trumpet).Ariel (nice name, by the way) is one of my Disney princesses of election. She looks pretty as a mermaid, but I prefer her as a human. She is simply hot as a human. Plus, as a human she is more shy and adorable, looks more cute and even more innocent, as her face and those expressive, enormous blue eyes suggest. Like the movie itself gets better with time, Ariel looks more attractive with time. Her looks grow on you - at least they did on me. Ariel has qualities I highly appreciate on a woman.Title in Portugal: 'A Pequena Sereia'."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5464291/,"When you're a kid, things just seem big. Toilets look like they're 10 feet wide. I saw this when I was just a cherub. Ursula, I found her to be really scary. Now I see the rich humor in her worldview.Ariel is cool, she's just the best. When I was a kid, Part Of Your World was my favorite song. (That was before I discovered Fatboy Slim.)I only have one complaint: I know mermaids are magic, so that explains how they can breathe underwater. But how do fish breathe underwater? I've never understood that. Wouldn't the fishes' lungs get full of water? ðŸ¤•"
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272422/,"I probably never would have seen this movie if my mother hadn't persuaded me to take my little brother to see it. I enjoyed it a lot the first time, but it was only when I saw it again a couple of years later on video I realised just how superb a movie it is. It's not a clever or complex movie, it's not the kind of film which works on an adult level as well as on a children's one. However, three aspects of it make it truly great:1: The music. 'Under The Sea' richly deserved its Oscar, but 'Part Of Your World' deserved it even more.2. The animation. Quite simply, it's absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes in particular take your breath away.3. The Story. How can you resist a love story that touching?I urge anyone with even a touch of sentimentality about them to set their predjudices aside and see this movie."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2903187/,"""The Little Mermaid"" takes us on an animated journey into the life of ginger mermaid Ariel and her dream of becoming human. It's sensory overload for Ariel and for the viewer from start to finish, but in the most positive way. It's a bit sad that some of the voice actors here (Flotsam & Jetsam, Triton, Scuttle) are dead now, but as it's almost 25 years since this film was made just shows what a timeless classic it has become. My favorite moment was Ariel singing in the film early ""Part of Your World"" and swimming up to the moonlight. Such a beautifully mesmerizing song and scene. While it was IMHO the best song of the movie and I'm pretty surprised it did not get the Oscar nomination, all the other songs are really good as well. ""Under the Sea"", maybe my least favorite, won the Oscar. I see it more as a ""Hakuna Matata"", a great fun song with little depth, so it's a bit surprising it was chosen as the best song at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards. ""Kiss the Girl"" is an amazing love song about taking the initiative and is very much worth listening to, just like ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", one of Disney's best villain songs ever. The latter is sung by Ursula, the main antagonist here and, long before she becomes a giant monster, already an epic villain here that may have changed the way we perceive octopuses forever to the negative.Ariel's best friend is a yellow-blue fish with the voice of a child, who rarely speaks, but is always loyal to her, even if he's scared quickly and it certainly doesn't help that there's always sharks around under the sea. Another friend is a bird who teaches Ariel about the human world and always knows what it is used for when Ariel shows him another item from the human world. Sadly, these descriptions are never accurate, which Ariel doesn't know of course, so she uses a fork for combing her hair at some point for example. Story-wise Ariel happens to rescue a Prince from drowning. Her father, however, doesn't want her to have any contact with humans, so he destroys her cavern which includes a giant collection of human things. Desperate and disappointed Ariel goes to see the sea witch Ursula and makes a deal with her. When she seems to be winning the deal, Ursula appears and tricks the prince into thinking she's the real Ariel. But of course, there's a happy ending as in pretty much every Disney film.One character I haven't mentioned so far, is Sebastian, who in my opinion is a definite contender for best supporting character in a Disney movie. He really leaves nothing to be desired. Initially loyal to Triton and instructed to look after Ariel, he's quickly captivated by her charm more and more as the film progresses and the very moment he realizes how Ariel will be unhappy for the rest of her life if she stays under the sea is just so much filled with excellence. Oh did I mention, he's also the royal court composer and a crab? Besides that, he's probably also the character who will provide the most comic relief and be the children's favorite. His chase scenes with the cook are simply hilarious. And when he assembles the orchestra, it's a win-win for everybody as we see ducks playing drums on turtle's bellies and the wildest ways music and performances can take by all the sea creatures involved.This animated version of Hans Christian Andersen's tale is simply a thing of beauty. It certainly is my new favorite film from 1989. The underwater world they created is pure movie magic, a feast for eyes and ears. Watch it with the one you love and you'll have a great time. It's also a great watch for fathers with their daughters thanks to the Triton-Ariel storyline. Most animated films these days are funny and stunning to look at, but hardly any reach the level of ""The Little Mermaid"" especially in terms of emotional impact: the longing for love, the longing for freedom, even if you have to make sacrifices for it, or just the way all kinds of human relationships are displayed metaphorically with the help of mermaids, fish and all kinds of other sea animals. Very much recommended."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272392/,"Yeah, yeah... It's the little mermaid, the same cute barbie-like character little girls love so much... But the movie is great. If you just free yourself from the sissy pink image of the movie you're in for a treat.The songs are great, by the same team who gave us Little Shop Of Horrors: Alan Menken and Howard Ashman who teamed up in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin as well. Aladdin was their last project together with Ashman's untimely death from AIDS in 1991.The story is funny and romantic, so who cares if it's not following the original tale? A perfect movie for everyone, not just little girls."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5793724/,"My now grown-up daughters wore out only 2 VHS movies when they were children: This movie and the original movie version of ""Annie"". (It takes between 60 to 100+ ""runs"" through a typical good-quality VCR to do this.) Their favorite song was ""Part of Your World"" which my (at the time) 11 year-old daughter sang on stage in full costume, at school. I still have this on a VHS ""home movie"". Truly amazing in every respect: Animation, adaptation. original story, songs and orchestration. Great voice actors. Still a favorite to this day; now with my grandkids. Is it a ""girl's movie""? Yes and no. As a (male) adult I thoroughly enjoy viewing it, even today. Their grandmother enjoys it as well. It was somewhat controversial in 1989, with the exaggerated-impossible ""teen-age figure"" of Ariel. Buddy Hackett as the seagull and Sebastian the Crab (Samuel E. Wright) steal every scene they appear in. Pat Carroll is deliriously evil as Ursula the Sea-Witch who comes to an explosive end (which some critics deemed too violent.) Entertaining and fun with a beautiful, happy ""Disney Ending"", which is far superior to the Hans Christian Anderson tale, which doesn't end well at all."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1740796/,"There is (in my view) only one criticism which can be levelled against this film, and that is that it plays fast and loose with Andersen's original in terms of the ending. I first read Andersen's stories as a child, and The Little Mermaid had a fairly typical unhappy ending. Personally, I thought the Mermaid deserved better and, on taking my kids to see this movie when it was first released, I was delighted to see that the people at Disney had given her the ending I always wanted for her.The very first sequence, of Prince Eric's ship looming out of the mist, took my breath away.I can understand Under The Sea getting all the attention - it is, after all, very jolly and colourful. But, to me, it pales into insignificance next to Kiss The Girl (soulful, and with a far better vocal performance), Poor Unfortunate Souls (where sinister turns into nightmare, with a sensational vocal performance from Pat Carroll delivering clever lyrics) and, most of all Part Of Your World.I think this may be the most perfect song sequence ever committed to celluloid - the song itself intertwines several plot elements, teenage angst and the generation gap, and bucketloads of emotion in a complex rhyming scheme loaded with clever wordplay. Jodi Benson's vocal is sublime and so are the visuals - it still brings tears to my eyes after repeated viewings. And the reprise... choreographing the final ""world"" to an orchestral crescendo and the crashing of the wave behind Ariel in Copenhagen mode may be corny but, by heaven, it certainly works! Howard Ashman is sadly missed!"
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272421/,"No other Disney movie is a good as THE LITTLE MERMAID. It is one of my favorite Disney films of all time. It is truly a classic film that will forever live in film history. While I didn't really enjoy the songs, I still love the remainder of the movie. I like the ending most of all. It is one of the darkest endings ever seen in a Disney film. I really don't have much to say on this film at the moment, but if anything is going to be said about this movie, let me say this: If you haven't yet seen this wonderful movie, see it now! Having not seen it is a crime! This one gets 5/5."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272393/,"The mermaid herself is charming.  She is animated with real passion - and voiced with real passion too, by Jodi Benson, who provides a powerful argument that whoever provides the speaking voice should also provide the singing voice.  She is an innocent heroine but by no means a colourless one. That the prince should fall in love with her, on just seeing her and hearing her voice, is entirely credible.The same could not be said for Andersen's original mermaid, who is a very cold fish indeed, solely concerned with grabbing immortality, considering the prince as no more than a handy means to it.  It's this (and the high value placed on Christianity at the expense of decency) that makes Andersen's ending so insufferable.  Obviously, another ending had to be found; and while it must be said that the big ending Musker and Clements came up with is a weak one, it must also be said that it's an improvement.Musker and Clements still have a problem with their finales (witness `Aladdin' and `Hercules'), but they have countervailing strengths, and those strengths are most apparent here.  The songs are all exceptionally staged (the well-known `Under the Sea' actually being the least effective), the comedy is sharp and well-timed, and - more obviously here than anywhere else - they really believe in what they're doing.  They give credit to Howard Ashman for this and they could be right; whatever the reason, an air of innocence and sincerity pervades `The Little Mermaid' which makes it - and her - utterly irresistible."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272449/,"The Little Mermaid is one of the best Disney films of the 80's! It's such a wonderful film and is such a tear jerker, lol. The songs, the story, the animation, the voices, were just so wonderful and perfect. This is the film that I'm sure will go on for generations to come, I just showed it to my cousin recently, he's 6, and he just loves it as well. I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and I just wanted a friend like Sebastian, he was so much fun, even though he's somewhat of a buzz kill, he can really get the party going. Just the whole story is a blast to watch and is so beautiful.Ariel is one of the many princesses of King Triton's mighty kingdom under the sea, but she has a different dream. She goes up constantly to the shore to collect human items and wonders what it would be like to be a human instead of a mermaid. One day when she gets into a nasty fight with her father, Ursella, an evil octopus woman who wants to take over King Triton's kingdom, grants Ariel's wish, but she can only stay human if she can get her crush, Eric, to say her name, sounds easy, right? Well, Ursella takes her voice away, but her intentions are for Ariel to fail and make sure that she takes over the kingdom.The Little Mermaid is such a fun Disney film and is a great treasure of our time. I just love the song ""Under the sea"", it's so much fun to sing and dance too, I admit it, I'm a dork, I still sing and dance to it when I see it. I highly recommend this movie for anyone, it's a true Disney classic that is so much fun, I guarantee you that you might shed a tear when Ariel says ""Daddy"", you'll see what I mean when you watch it.10/10"
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2947813/,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first of three true classics from the ""middle era"" of Disney animation ... along with Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) ... this 1989 version of Hans Christian Anderson's 1837 story brought musical theatre to an animated children's fairy tale. It was also the 28th Disney film, and the final to utilize hand-painted cel animation.The Blu-Ray release to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary is truly stunning in color, brightness, clarity and sound. An explosion of sight and sound occurs during the incredible cacophony of joy and cheer better known as the Best Song Oscar winner ""Under the Sea"". The calypso style was a very creative choice by musical directors Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.Of course, the star of the show is Ariel, the rebellious 16 year old mermaid who dreams of walking on the beach and dancing with the Prince. Ariel's remarkable vocals (""Part of Your World"") are provided by Jodi Benson, who beautifully captures the innocence and longing necessary for the character. Samuel E Wright is the smooth voiced Jamaican crab Sebastian, who not only takes lead on ""Under the Sea"", but also on ""Kiss the Girl"". The other standout is Pat Carroll as Ursula the Sea Witch. She is the perfect villain vs Ariel, and is quite a commentary on the actions of those who are power hungry.Written and directed by John Clements and Ron Musker, the film was a bit different for its time because of the depth of Ariel's character. This was a typical teenager going against her strict parent and dreaming of a better life. Ariel has a mind of her own and is willing to chase her dreams ... even if it's a boy from the proverbial ""other side of the tracks"" and with a Faustian negotiation. From a technical perspective, the artwork is spectacular and movements are full and fluid (sorry for the pun). This came 5 years after Ron Howard's live action Splash with Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah. If you ever doubt the power that expert animation can possess, just compare the emotion and charm in those two.This latest Blu-Ray release has some very interesting special features. We are treated to interviews with the film's animators as well as a peek inside the Disney Animation studios, now on its third generation of animators. Much reverence is provided to The Nine Old Men ... the original group of animators hand picked by Walt Disney. The last of the nine men died in 2008, and their trainees are now mentoring the most excited new group that is kicking out some new classics like Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph. What's that word ... circle of life."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272433/,"I saw this movie when I was very young and I loved it. It had a perfect fairy-tale ending and totally followed the formula for Disney movies in a great way. It really got it's message across with catchy tunes and fun characters.On the down side, while it had a great message, it didn't stay true to what Hans Christian Andersen wrote. I hadn't read Andersen's version until very recently, but I loved it. I thought it had a much better and far more realistic message than the Disney movie. Andersen said that if you're a good person, while you may not get your reward in life, being good is it's own reward. Disney, on the other hand, said that if you risk everything for the one you love, things will work out in the end. While that's a nice message for little kids that is very unrealistic. Good people are hurt all the time.I've heard people say that if girls grow up watching this, they will learn that big breasts, a small waist, and having a man by your side are what's important in life. This movie was made the year I was born, so naturally, I grew up on it. I don't hold myself to unrealistic standards or feel like I must have a man to go on. So, while I don't know about all the other little girls out there, but Disney didn't corrupt me."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4566398/,"The Little Mermaid harkens back to the simple, straightforward qualities of Disney's golden era. A classic celebrating the impulsivity of youthful love and the search for a new identity. It's a faithful and brilliant showcase for animation as an enchanting, lively medium; and ushered in a new era of masterpieces from Disney. There's certainly some nostalgia attached to my love for this film but I don't even care...it's a wonderful little movie."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1369848/,"This animated film brought the Disney company out of its long slump and you can see why it spurred a comeback: there is a lot to like in this movie.It features outstanding animation: brilliant colors and beautiful scenes, along with interesting characters and pretty good songs. Frankly, I didn't care that much for the lead character, the young girl, but the little crab was the show- stealer, at least for me. He spoke with a West Indies accent and did a couple of cool musical numbers....and was easily the funniest and most-entertaining of all the characters.I have only one major complaint about this story. The message that ""parents should let the kids go,"" inferring they know best, that if you let them decide what is best, they'll live happily ever after....is irresponsible and just plain wrong. Hollywood loves to show little kids are smarter than their parents, which might sound nice to the young audience but it is a very dangerous message. Too bad, because than that this would have been a super film for all ages. It's still pretty darn good."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2422417/,"The Little Mermaid is one of those films I grew up with when I was a kid - something that the whole family can watch and never really get sick of. The imagination brought into this fairy tale (despite the fact that the ending is vastly changed from the original to please the kids) is simply superb. Songs, music, characters are all terrific.While I think Beauty and the Beast stands as Disney's best animated film, The Little Mermaid is still one of the top ones to check out. A story about Aeriel - the young mermaid curious about the human world who ends up falling for Prince Eric of the human race.And all the other cute characters such as Sebastian, Flounder, not to mention a very sinister villain with the Sea Witch. It all makes for a great time and has a good deal of emotion in it too.I really miss Disney films made in this era - they were done so well and I will always be a huge fan of them. The ones nowadays - while they aren't horrible, just seem to be a bit too modern and hence don't have that magic as the old ones - probably because they focus more on doing references to other things rather than coming up with original ideas that felt fresh."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272408/,"The Little Mermaid is one of Disney's best animated motion pictures. It tells the classic Hans Christian Anderson story of a mermaid who wishes she could be human in order to capture the love of a human prince. The animation is beautiful, in fact I think this is one of Disney's most flawless films. It features lovable characters: Ariel the little mermaid is one of my favorite 'Disney girls', Sebastian the crab, Scuttle the wacky seagull, Flounder the... flounder, Triton Ariel's father the Sea King and of course prince charming- Eric. And don't think I forgot the most despised octopus of the oceans- Ursula and her two eels Flotsam and Jetsum. Great beginning and great ending... and of course a lovable story. The music is beautiful (and rightfully won the Oscar for best score and best song). The score is by Alan Menken (who also provided us with the scores of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast). Some of the most beautiful Disney songs are in The Little Mermaid- Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl and for a little bit of dancin' Under the Sea. A movie for all ages, you will be enchanted by Ariel's world under the sea, by the wacky characters, the cruel but in a strange way lovable Ursula, the score, the songs, the story and the animation. I hope everybody has The Little Mermaid in their video collection to one day show their children and grandchildren or any youngster (or adult for that matter). You will be captured by Ariel and want to be part of her (most intriguing) world."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2893948/,"This is one of the greater full length animated feature films that was made after Walt Disney. A story about Ariel the Little Mermaid, who yearns to be part of the human world and who fell in love with human Prince Eric in the process. She makes a deal with Ursula the Sea Witch and traded her voice for legs so she could rise to the surface of the waters. What follows is a romantic story in how Ariel tries to win Eric's heart without her voice and an exciting race against time to ensure Ariel remains human, otherwise, returning back to the ocean and into the evil Ursula's custody.Ron Clements and John Musker did an outstanding job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention at the start of the film with a musical sequence on the Prince's ship, and then a spectacular entry under the sea when we are introduced to the mermaids, helped by a powerful music score. The solid plot quickly identifies the story's main issue, Ariel, who is tired of being treated like a child by her father King Triton. The issue is then expanded as Ariel struggles to win Eric's heart when she goes to the human world while, at the same time, not knowing that Ursula has devious plans of her own to control the sea. All these plot elements and twists make this a very exciting Disney movie from start to finish.The characters are very lovable and memorable, especially Flounder, Sebastian (my favorite) and Scuttles. They added humor and spirit in the movie as they help Ariel with her issues. The music score and songs are some of cinema's best work - Alan Menken and Howard Ashman did a marvelous job. ""Under the Sea"" is a very lively and dynamic Calyso-type song and ""Part of your World"" is a moving and commanding song; Jodi Benson had the perfect voice for Ariel - very soothing and serene. And, the artwork and graphics are some of the best I have seen in an animated film.Overall, one of the best movies from Disney and remains a timeless fairytale for all ages.Grade A"
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3110875/,"A good family film with a cute version the story. As it is written so it is said, Disney's movie is *loosely* based on Hans Christian Andersen's story - so you cannot compare Andersen's story with Disney's film. Disney's film is a colorful tale with quite a few comical characters.I enjoyed this film quite a bit but I would have liked to have seen this movie a bit ""darker"" in tone (animation and story). Under ocean is a mysterious place - so I would have preferred this movie with more of a ""gloomy"" atmosphere and story instead of being mainly a bright place to live. Of course it's just a matter of personal preference.Yes The Little Mermaid is a wonderful film. You could make this a double feature with movies like: ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"".8/10"
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1271479/,"''The Little Princess'' is a great movie from Disney and also one of my favorites from it. Ariel, a 16 years old mermaid,is one of the princesses of the sea with her older sisters and her dad, king Triton. The only problem is that she is unhappy with her ''under sea life'', since she always dreamed to live in the human's world and to have legs to walk.Things only get worst when Ariel starts to fall in love with Eric, a beautiful brunet prince that she rescues one day. Decided to become a human, she makes a pact with the evil Ursula and sells her voice as a payment to be with Eric: If after some days, Eric kisses her with true love, she can be a human for eternity. But if the opposite happens, she will be Ursula's slave. The only ones who knows her secret besides Ursula is Sebastian and Flounder.I think this movie is very worthwhile. The only thing to mention, is that is loosely based upon the story by Hans Christian Andersen."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272435/,"I was definitely no kid when I saw ""The Little Mermaid""; in fact, I was 20. I was thoroughly captivated by this movie - one of the last real delights from Disney's regular animation crews (before they had to get help from Pixar and Tim Burton) - and the Mouse couldn't have wished for a better movie to get them back on the proper road, animation-wise. (Of course, after this, ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" they've slipped a bit - though they're still better than DreamWorks.)Though not exactly loyal to the original story - Hans Christian Andersen was much more keen on unhappy endings - it's doubtful it would have worked as well if it had. The movie has just about everything going for it... lush animation, spirited musical numbers (this started Alan Menken's run of success for Disney, and he's surely had enough time to refresh himself by now, and for us all to forget ""Pocahontas""), wonderfully evil villain, likeable supporting players, and my all-time favourite Disney heroine, the endearing and lovely Ariel (remember the episode of ""Cheers"" when Norm said he fancied her? She got a lot of real life guys' hearts - beat that, Princess Fiona from ""Shrek"").And as a plus, the subsequent TV series (set before the movie) even managed to capture some of the spirit of the movie. But go for the original... a classic."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2877376/,"Mermaid Princess Ariel wants to live up above the ocean floor in the world of humans. She makes a deal with an evil sea witch named Ursula and leaves the ocean for life on dry land. When things go array in both her beloved worlds, Ariel must enlist the help of her fish friend Flounder and crab Sebastian to set things right.It's become almost a monthly ritual to pull this out and watch it ever since my kids starred in a local stage play based on the movie.What can be said about ""The Little Mermaid"" that already hasn't been? I think its award nominations and wins speak for themselves. Boys and girls of all ages adore this treasure. As stated above, it's even found life as a stage play performed around the world by children's and adult theaters."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272430/,"Disney animated films had become somewhat second-rate by 1989 and it appeared that one of the great genres in the cinema was on life-support. But that all changed with ""The Little Mermaid"". The film is a cinematic classic that tells the story of a young mermaid princess who just wants to be human so she makes a deal with an evil sea witch to get her wish, but she loses her beautiful voice in the process and she must be kissed by her true love to get it back. A really great motion picture that has some really memorable songs in it. 5 stars out of 5."
The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1677891/,What can I say about this movie. I grew up watching this and I don't care if I am a little girl or not I love this movie. I think it is really well done and it maybe the last of the classic Disney films. For me the best part is the songs. I love all of them and I think they are all really well done and fit into the story well. Having Sebastian being a conductor made it a little easier. I must say I still get a bit of a wave of emotion when I see King Tritan give up his daughter so she can be happy. One of my favorite scenes which amazes me every time I see it is when Sebastian decides to help Ariel. The look on Ariel's face and Sebastian's body language are amazing. I think they really were able to create a whole slew of characters with very unique characteristics and movements. I also have to say I thought the use of the accents and how none of them seemed to come from anywhere made me smile because it was silly and just clichÃ©. This will be one of the movies that my kids will watch and will in my mind always be a classic
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1485389/,"This one is another example of the Disney guys' ability of traducing even the darkest stories to the screen. Aladdin is originally one of those dark stories with complicated language and plot, but directors Clements and Musker look beyond the obstacle and, once again, produce a great animated movie for children and adults. This film is wonderful. From the beginning, when a mysterious merchant sings one of the greatest ""onde upon a time"" songs ever, passing from the romantic moment, you are so fascinated with colors, camera movements and great voices, you can't take you eyes off of the screen. Incredible characters, a strong villain, good songs and breath-taking soundtrack and scenes, it has everything a Disney classic needs to be great. And this great would not be so great if Robin Williams wasn't the genie. What a talented guy. Jonathan Freeman as Jafar is not far behind, he helps the making of the best Disney villain. The characters animation is soft and beautiful, uninterested, the way the directors like. No matter the climax concludes with a (kind of) inexpressive phrase, it's only a minimum detail, and minimum details is for Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale (Beauty and the Beast), who seem to only care about that. Clements and Musker are a lot of steps ahead because they are the ones who inherited Walt Disney's magic. Let's hope they stay active for a good time."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1266161/,"Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1571053/,"I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day. The villain is an ""Oil Can Harry"" mustached dastardly employee of the king who desires king-like powers. His scenes, however, are tempered with humor thanks to his New York City-sounding obnoxious parrot, who provides most of the movie's slapstick humor.Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302756/,"Ah, Aladdin. The songs, the characters, everything!The story is this, Aladdin a poor street urchin who is tricked into getting a magic lamp for Jafar. Jafar is a royal vizer for the simple sultan who dosn't realize he too is being duped by Jafar. After Aladdin discovers he has the lamp he rubs it and POOF, all the classic Disney magic explodes on screen! Aladdin then has to learn that he has to be himself and not pretend to be others. Starring Robin Williems as the great humorous Genie, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will love the music. OH! Let me tell you about the music, if you can you must must MUST get the soundtrack! It maybe hard to find but it is so worth it! The music is simply great. My personal favorite is ""Prince Ali"". I give thins movie a 9 outta 10."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302698/,"Aladdin is without a doubt one of Disney's better movies. The animation is excellent. The characters are very realistic, surprising and rare for an animated movie. The songs are very good and memorable (favorite has to ""Friend Like Me""). Many pop culture references are here and even if you do not notice them, they are made very hilarious by Robin Williams. Williams provides the comic relief which is vital to the movie's success. This is one of the best Disney movies in the last decade, if not ever."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3357279/,"The film opens with a merchant's tell-tale song, performed by the classic Robin Williams. It begins the (inaccurate, but good) story of a boy named Aladdin, who has the power to open the Cave of Wonders, a place that holds magic and wealth. We don't meet Aladdin yet, as it first introduces us to the villain of the story, the well-written ""Jafar"". Jafar is cunning and witty. He is a classic villain, with a terrifying look and an evil laugh. We are shown Jafar and another man trying to open the Cave of Wonders. Since the other man is not Aladdin, he cannot go into the cave and come out unharmed. Jafar grows angry after learning this fate, and hatches a plan to find Aladdin.Now, we center on a scraggly boy in a marketplace, stealing bread. There's the beautiful singing of Scott Weinger that immediately grabs your heart. Guards are trying to catch Aladdin for stealing. Through this song, you realize the boy is a poor orphan unable to afford food. He owns a pet monkey named Abu, who has an attitude of his own. Aladdin escapes the guards with an allusion to a magic carpet as his escape method, and lands in an alley, while the guards land in manure.Now, one may think Aladdin deserves to be caught for stealing. It's at this moment that Aladdin notices two starving children and gives his own bread to them. Abu does the same, with a little persuasion. I won't give everything away, but what I will say is that this film is something I hold very dear to my heart. Throughout the past 20+ years, it has touched the hearts of many. It's got a great musical score, amazing character development, great voice actresses and actors (including Robin Williams!), and a story that you can't forget. This movie truly is magical."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302703/,"I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the ""generic"" people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0950861/,"This movie has three elements that are important for an animated Disney movie: Great songs, a good villain and a great sidekick.The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.The story is good and the pace is high. ""Aladdin"" is not too short and it's not too long, it's not too immature and it's not too mature, it's a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it's no ""Beauty and the Beast"") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects.9/10"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1079397/,"I grew up watching this film and along with Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella it is one of my favourite Disney films. I love it! Robin Williams is so good in it. He's hilarious. This film isn't just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven't seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn't in them and decided that they wouldn't be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to ""A Whole new World"". I'm hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You're never too old to watch a classic Disney film."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1463875/,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I have loved this movie since I saw it when it came out in 1992. I have watched it so many times, that I know all the words. I think this movie is great to watch with the kids. Or even if you don't have kids. I own all three on DVD and VHS. It is the first movie my daughter saw. I think it is the best Disney movie ever made. I like all three, but the first is still my favorite one. it's the original that sticks with you. the others may be good, but not as good as the first. I hope everyone can enjoy this movie. I think no matter how old you are, or no matter what you do, that there is always room for a good Disney movie."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2556820/,"Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin."" I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1699755/,"The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.""Aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling ""Prince Abooboo"" to ""Prince Ali""), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.""Aladdin"" is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...I'd only wish that ""Aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.This should definitely be on Top 250."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2534639/,"I will never forget the first time I watched ""Aladdin"", I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when ""Aladdin"" was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of ""The Lion King"" were starting to screen. ""Aladdin"" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out ""The Jungle Book"".I know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes ""Aladdin"" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as GenieÂ… but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. ""Aladdin"" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.""Kid's day in the USA!"" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered ""Aladdin"", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.Needless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time Â… it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.And for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.I must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for ""Aladdin"" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.And then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see Â… and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.I feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for ""Aladdin"".But maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of ""Aladdin"", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5498180/,"From start to finish, Aladdin is timeless classic! Very funny, very exciting and intense, amazing visuals, and excellent pacing! The story is also amazing, as are the characters. Holy crap do the characters in this movie rock! They all play a very important role in the movie. You have Aladdin and Abu as two fearless adventurers/thieves, Jasmine as one of the best and most charming Disney princesses of all time, Jafar as the highly cunning, intelligent, and awesome sorcerer and one of the best Disney villains of all time, Iago, who has to be the best henchman of any villain in any movie (he and Jafar are the best together), and of course, the Genie. From his design to his style to pretty much everything there is about him, he absolutely steals the show! From the moment he appears during the movie, he is just seems so much like the the star of the movie. Robin Williams as the Genie is one of the best performances in any animated movie. Aladdin is such an awesome movie that I can't give it anything other than 10 out of 10"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2885097/,"Aladdin is a key piece to the comeback of Disney. Before Aladdin, Disney was still struggling after a long period of fail animated block-busters films. The biggest blow to the company, came in 1981's The Fox and the Hound when long-time animator Don Bluth left Disney, taking 11 Disney animators with him. Disney came back with 1989's Little Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast, but with the success of Aladdin, Disney spark the era known as the Disney Renaissance, that continue until the early 2000's. These film restore public and critical interest back into Disney. Aladdin was a very controversial choice for a kid's movie when it came out. Aladdin is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. It's still unknown if Aladdin is not actually part or not part of the 1001 Arabian Nights stories. The tale of Aladdin was somewhat violence and had various forms of erotica. The original story had Aladdin, with the help of his magical ring full of Djin, kidnapped Jasmine on her honeymoon. How romantic, a kidnapping movie! Glad, they change the plot somewhat from the original tale. One of the verses of the opening song ""Arabian Nights"" in the film had to be altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) due to its violence lyrics about cutting ears. There is also protest raise by another scene where Aladdin is mistaken by critics due to the line, 'Good Kitty, take off' which the critics thought he was saying 'Good teenagers, take off your clothes'. Because of the controversy, Disney replaced the phrase with ""Down, kitty"" on the DVD release. People have also took noticed with the similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's film The Thief and the Cobbler AKA The Princess and the Cobbler (1993). Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, so they have been dispute who rip off who even up to today. The film story is about Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) a poor but kind-hearted Agrabah thief who finds himself arrested for thievery. Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) promise him a reward in return for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, a mysterious magical cave. Jafar tries to betray him for the lamp, and Aladdin find himself trapped in the collapsed cave. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams), who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Seeing this as his way out, Aladdin created a new life as Prince Ali to get closer to the princess Jasmine (voice by Linda Larkin). Jafar starts to question Prince Ali believing him as the poor thief that he betrayed and start to make plans to steal the lamp once and for all. The movie has a great message for the children about being yourself and not allow yourself to be imprisoned. Glad they didn't go with the Greed is good message. The animation is great. Even today, I have to say when the Cave of Wonders, Sand Tiger come alive, it brings chills down my neck. The magic carpet ride through the cave was collapsing was intense. I can't help thinking of those scenes, even now. The music to the film is ground breaking good to hear. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is amazing. I love 'A Whole New World'. One of the best love songs of the 1990's. It has an amazing melody that complements the scenery very well. I too love how the song speeds up, giving it a very romantic yet magical and adventurous feel to it. The other songs like 'Friends like me', 'Street Rat', 'One Jump Ahead' and 'Prince Ali' also work. I do have to say the 2004, Special Edition released kinda ruin it, by having a new song ""Proud of Your Boy"", performed by Clay Aiken which I thought was mediocre. Now there has been a couple of fan theories that goes with this film, that I like to address like The Merchant is the Genie. Both look very similar, and it seems to make sense because Robin Williams voices both characters. Another variation of this same theory says the man made the whole story up to sell the lamp, so Aladdin wasn't really a true story. The last theory is the most outlandish. Some people think that Aladdin takes place in a Post- Apocalyptic future where technological marvels had been long forgotten and been taking as magic. Some critics even think the Magic Carpet is a time- traveling device. The Genie proves this theory by making impressions of ancient, long-dead celebrities like Groucho Marx, and Jack Nicholson. Still, it can make sense that the Genie is an all-powerful being who can see into the future, so he can make jokes like those, but why would he make jokes that Aladdin wouldn't get. The truth is, Robin Williams was making cultural references jokes to get more people to see the film. Much of Robin Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed and it was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters for animation to work on. It was no surprised that the film has so many in-jokes impersonality as Robin is known for that at the time. This was a new type of Disney humor that wasn't in much kids movies at the time. Disney would later use this type of humor in other animation films like 2001's Emperor New Groove, and 1997's Hercules. In an odd way, Aladdin also take place in the same period as Hercules, so a crossover was used in later projects. Check out, Disney's first direct-to-video sequel, 1994's The Return of Jafar and the TV Show. 1996's Aladdin and the King of Thieves was OK so check it. Overall: Aladdin is a great nostalgia movie that takes us back to when we were kids. Worth watching."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6220075/,"A very fun movie that contains fun characters especially the genie, the carpet, the monkey and the parrot, and Robin Williams is better than Will Smith in the performance of the Genie character"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302681/,"This movie was the biggest film of '92, and it's easy to see why-a lotta fun, as a terrific Robin Williams performance carries it to heights it otherwise would not have gone to. Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.A great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now."

One day, at the market, he helps Princess Jasmine thinking that she is a regular girl,but under Jafar's orders (sultan's adviser)Aladdin is thrown in jail.Jasmine stays furious with Jafar's orders, but Jafar being an evil bastard, says to her that he asked to kill Aladdin. But many things that Jafar didn't think become true, and one of them is that Aladdin escaped from prison, and is the only person who can enter in a cave where the magical lamp is.(I don't need to say that he is the one who takes the lamp and become Genie's friend) But many things will happen, including Aladdin and Jasmine's meet as prince and princess."

Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302749/,"Aladdin is such an awesome move that still gets me excited to this day, I remember when I was 7 and I saw this in the theater and I just had so much fun. I am such a dork, I still love a lot of the Disney movies that I loved as a kid, but I think the reason that I love Aladdin so much is because this is one of the last Disney movies that was hand drawn animation, the reason I love hand drawn animation is because it feels more personal and that the crew put their heart and soul into it, you can tell by watching it. They got a great cast of voice actors including Scott Weinger from Full House and the always entertaining and hilarious Robin Williams. Robin was just a perfect choice for Genie, he brought a lot of energy to the movie and makes the genie a great character. Who knew that a kid's version of the Arabian Nights tale could be so great? This is a great Disney movie that I guarantee you're going to love.On a dark night, when Jafar attempts to access the Cave of Wonders, a magical cave which holds treasures beyond the wildest belief, above all is a magical oil lamp containing a genie is hidden. He and his talking parrot, Iago, learn that the only one who can enter the Cave of Wonders is the metaphorical ""Diamond in the Rough"". Meanwhile, in the palace of Agrabah, Jasmine, the beautiful teenage daughter of the Sultan, must be married before her upcoming birthday, but she rejects every prince she meets, as she wants to be married for true love and not merely for wealth. Later, Jasmine, frustrated with having her life lived for her climbs over the palace walls, and sees the marketplace for the first time, where she meets the street urchin Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, and the two young people are seen to be falling for each other. Jafar uses a machine to see that the ""diamond in the rough"" is Aladdin. Jafar sends a group of guards to capture Aladdin while Jasmine is still with him. Jasmine tells Jafar to release him, but Jafar lies and tells her he is already dead. Jafar, disguised as an elderly man, releases Aladdin from prison and leads him to the Cave of Wonders. They are told by the tiger-shaped head of the cave to touch nothing but the lamp. Aladdin enters the cave and encounters a magic carpet before finding the lamp. Abu tries to steal a ruby and causes the cave to start collapsing, but the carpet helps them to the entrance. Jafar takes the lamp from them and tries to kill them but Abu takes the lamp back and bites his arm, causing him to knock Abu back into the cave just as it collapses. When Aladdin awakens, Abu gives him the lamp which he had snatched from Jafar. After rubbing it, a genie is unleashed, revealing that he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin dupes the genie into freeing them from the cave without using up a wish. While contemplating his wishes, Aladdin asks the genie to make him into a prince so he can marry Jasmine. Iago later steals the genie's lamp back and brings it to Jafar, who becomes the genie's new master and uses his first wish to become sultan. Jafar then wishes to become a powerful sorcerer, Jafar then keeps the Sultan, the Genie, and Jasmine as his slaves. Aladdin must figure a way to save all of them and make things right again.Aladdin is just a great movie that I promise you'll love, it has great characters, beautiful animation, and a terrific and catchy soundtrack that you'll be singing all day. This was one of the rare Disney movies that you pretty much loved ALL the characters, even Iago who is voiced by Gilbert Gottfried, the voice is a bit much but he is great as well. I personally love both the carpet and the genie. Who knew that a carpet could have so much personality? I absolutely adore the ""Friend Like Me"" scene, it was incredible to watch and had terrific animation! If for some odd reason you haven't somehow seen this movie, I highly recommend that you do, this will probably go down in your favorites as well.10/10"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5260986/,Funny. Memorable animation. Robin Williams in top form. Stay away from the rehashed nostalgia-inspired live action horror show of 2019. The OG rings true.
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6145021/,"... or falafel or baba ghanoush, they all smell and taste outstanding, as outstanding as this piece of delicious and delightful Disney animation that gives satisfaction to the most devouring of cinephiles appetites. The cherry on the cake being the unique and brilliant voice of the genie, the voice of a true entertainer and genieus, the voice of the unforgettable, the one and only - Robin Williams. It just so happens to have an endearingly beautiful story as well."
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302704/,"Robin Williams is marvelous as the genie. Try to keep up! True, the film gets a little stereotypical and formulaic. But the energy and story will keep you entertained. The usual be yourself message at the end can be found just about anywhere, but I'm sure you won't mind.Half the fun of an animated film is trying to pick out all the actors' voices. Try and catch Williams, Scott Weinger, and Gilbert Gottfried.*** out of ****"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0302713/,"I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World."" The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!"
Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1263157/,"Simply a classic. The movie Aladdin is hilariously told with many many MANY funny moments. The genie his an all-time high in this classic film about a street rat and a princess. A great movie for young kids, but even adults will love the wonderfully amusing lines throughout the story. The songs in the movie are well-known and catchy. I even had a guy since one of them to a girl at a school dance! Everyone recognizes them, and it is our duty to make sure the next generations continues to appreciate such a wonderful work of art.A great movie for the entire family to sit down and watch together, it's good sometimes to take a blast to the past and enjoy some of those good ol' movies."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1054814/,"This is the best movie of all times.This movie came out in 1991, It has since produced 2 other movies to compliment it. I love this movie so much that I have started my own collect.If you have ever wondered what true love can be like this movie is for you. It gives you hope when you are down. I love it.I have seen this movie many many times and I can't get enough. I saw this movie as a teenager and I have been enchanted again and again. The music in this animation was great. Beauty and the beast won best picture and will for ever be the only one that will ever win this award as an animated movie because it was later given its own category.All of the characters in the film will fill your heart with happiness."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291240/,"a great movie story done with wondrous animation and lovely music.  the pacing was perfect, the music blended extremely well with the action, and each character was developed charmingly.  the contrast between the mean but insecure beast plays very well against the lovely but bright and secure belle.  the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow.  except for pinocchio, I don't know any disney movie more lovely. It's a movie that appeals to children of all ages, especially adults : )enough of the ""technical stuff""  let's get on to my emotional attachment to the movie.I remember the first time I saw B&tB so vividly; I was completely enthralled by the movie that all I could do on the way home was smile and cry.  I've seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps. Angela Landsbury as Mrs. Potts sings the title song with so much feeling that every time I hear the song, I'm swept away back to that ballroom.
I was also moved by Belle's strength of self worth and generosity.  She is a heroine I'd love girls to emulate.  She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal.  She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.I've loved this movie from the start, and it has grown into an obsession. I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift.  So I know my opinion is strongly biased : )  but I hope you get a chance to see this film and judge for yourself.  I realize it is difficult to get access to the videos or laser discs (check out the spanish version cover imdb is using in B&tB's page) but it is well worth the search.  The first time is most magical.  I envy you."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291282/,"Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply:  love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.'  And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation. 
	The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep.  Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.  Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him:  If he will release her father, she will stay in his place.  The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever.  And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.	With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.  There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly.  A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).  	The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster).  There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made:  As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.  And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.  It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films. 
	One final note:  Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6343678/,"One of the best Disney movies, Belle is the best Disney princess. The message of the film was excellent. The characters of the servants in the palace were very interesting. Evil wasn't the movie very well, but it fulfilled the purpose, the songs in the movie. The pictures were great in the movie, so beautiful. I love the old style of drawing"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291340/,"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one ""Beauty and the Beast"" is worth a thousand ""Akira""s. And ""Shrek""s. And, I'm willing to bet, ""Treasure Planet""s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - this is the real best picture of 1991."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291354/,"Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.Bell is just a simple girl in her town in France, she reads books constantly and her father is an inventor. They are sort of the outcasts of their town due to their ""oddness"". But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have. One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner. Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts. Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken. They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean. The songs are just so lovely and perfect for the scenes that they are performed for. Beauty and the Beast, the song, was just one of the most touching songs ever. This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.10/10"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1057822/,"This is the most amazing movie i have ever seen. Everything about it is magnificent. The music goes perfect with the scenes and mood of the film, and the characters have personalities that go with the flow of the movie. Every event leads to another one and keeps you watching. I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out. The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are: -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more ""provincial life"" and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves himWhat really makes it the best is the voices too. Just listening to hte music without the movie can make you feel the same way. i am a real Disney lover but i would highly recommend this one above all others."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489315/,"I still remember watching this movie when I was very little. I did not appreciate it as much then, but now because I am older, I can cherish this blessed masterpiece. The music in this movie is one of the best film scores ever and contains the catchiest Disney tunes. Who could ever forget the ever-popular ballroom scene? This movie, in my opinion was Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's best! I also think that this is the best Disney movie made after the great Walt Disney passed away.I had the opportunity of seeing the Special Edition on IMAX. What an experience! The scenes were breathtaking to see on such a large screen. I even found the new song ""Human Again"" very entertaining.It's such a shame that Disney hasn't made a movie like this since ""Mulan"". ""Beauty and the Beast"" will be forever remembered as the epitome of modern-day Disney movies (and should have won the Best Picture Oscar instead of ""The Silence of the Lambs""). Bravo to Disney!"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1207886/,"This is the best movie/cartoon i've ever seen! I just love it! I watched this movie 20 or more times I think. The songs are terrific. The dress of Belle is absolutely amazing, isn't it? :) The little cup of tea is really sweet. I think the voices suit really good for all characters. I would like to see ""Beauty and the Beast on Ice"" but for now it's really impossible. I think that who saw this show is really really lucky! ""Transformation"" part of this movie is good enough and I think you should pay attention the music because Disney orchestra is terrific playing the music. Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast!!! I don't like Celine Dion and her voice either but Peabo Bryson sings very well. He just showed his talent! The new part of show in special edition is good enough. I just love the song."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291243/,"Who can resist this beautiful story? I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast. Another Disney masterpiece."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5498204/,"Truly one of the greatest animated films ever put on the big screen. This film is extremely emotional, romantic, and magical. The incredible characters are so lovely to be around. Has a FEW all time great musical numbers that will stick with you forever. A message that will forever be important and truly a tale as old as time!"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1782294/,"It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but when this age-old phrase is converted to modern times, it translates to ""the desktop is mightier than the pencil."" There's no denying that the computer has become a tool used across the world, whether for political reasons, or for business or especially for educational purposes. Computers have also been adopted by the film industry to give their works of art a shinier feel and along with the visual effects wizards, the filmmakers who use these electronic devices the most are the animators. After a while, it was uncertain whether the cel-based animation used to create such classics like The Little Mermaid and Pinocchio would be completely dropped in favour of the quicker and slicker style. While studios like DreamWorks may have given up on them, the folks at the world's pioneering animation studio are still behind the pencil-and-paper animation that has enchanted families for generations. Looking back at one of their essential works, Beauty and the Beast brings back memories of not only nostalgia, but also warmth. Quite possibly the greatest love story ever told, this ""tale as old as time"" has always been told by bringing pen to paper. From its candle-lit beginnings by a French writer many years ago to the Disney animators who brought joys to people of all ages, Beauty and the Beast has always touched the heart.The main part of what makes Beauty and the Beast such a brilliant film is the fact that the relationship between the two title characters doesn't feel artificial or one-dimensional, even though they're drawn on paper. Unlike other famous fairy tales, Beauty and the Beast feels quite realistic in its definition of love. The story breaks all conventions by not going the ""love at first sight"" route and letting the romance progress at a reasonable pace. Belle also proves to be the most interesting Disney heroine, as she doesn't fit the norm of typical princesses like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Unlike the aforementioned characters, Belle is not bland, but actually as a personality. She defines individuality and seeks to do more than just marry a prince. Her annoyance at Gaston is not only humorous, but also shows that her ideas of romance don't consist of ""a rustic hunting lodge... my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife, massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs... we'll have six or seven,"" as Gaston puts it. The Beast is also a rather stubborn, but loving personality. Despite his tough exterior is a nice person at heart which Belle begins to realise the more into the relationship they enter.Adding to the brilliance of the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast are the songs from Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Although both did terrific work on The Little Mermaid and their cult musical Little Shop of Horrors, the music in Beauty and the Beast stands as their best. The title theme song is quite possibly one of the most romantic songs ever written, combining beautiful lyrics with a very memorable melody. This song enhances the film's famous ballroom scene to ever impressive heights, already helped by the breathtaking animation in the sequence. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was not written as just a way to sell soundtracks and win Oscars. It adds another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other. It is both moving and deep. The other songs provided by the team also contribute wonderfully to the film, from a show-stopping Broadway number called ""Be Our Guest"" to the very funny ode to ""Gaston."" They're bursting with energy and humour made even more poignant by the fact they would feature the last lyrics written by Ashman (who had also already contributed some work to Aladdin). It's a brilliant way to end his career and the end credits homage him perfectly: ""To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)""Probably one of the most important ingredients that make Beauty and the Beast such a success is the startling animation. The animators at Disney did a terrific job at making everything absolutely perfect, from the character designs to the sets. Each character has their feel, whether comedic or dramatic, and the animators allow them to breath, seamlessly combining the actor's voice to the moving drawings. The sets are also worthy of mention, particularly the look of the Beast's castle. The Gothic castle is drawn and painted beautifully from top to behind, so much so you're forgetting you're watching an animated film. The film is bright and colourful, but also dark and dreary when necessary. As mentioned before, the ballroom sequence combines Menken and Ashman's music with the animation flawlessly, giving a completely magical feel to it. When computers are brought into the scene, it seams in perfectly, not feeling distracted in the least. Beauty and the Beast most certainly stands as Disney animation at its finest.Some of the best animated films in the world have come from the Walt Disney studios and Beauty and the Beast is deservedly one of their crown jewels. At the film's release, it was honoured with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, a rare feat for an animated film. It proves that like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1004939/,"Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores. You will enjoy it!"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1047871/,"When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time Â– only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However with this film I was quite taken by how classy the whole affair was, with great effort being shown in every area from the animation, to the songs through to the emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with a nice sense of wonder throughout. The story doesn't really hit many bum notes (I thought Gaston's sidekick was a bit too obvious and half cooked) and it is interesting and enjoyable for the vast majority of the time. The story and comedy is aimed at both adults and children Â– but the stuff for kids is not basic pratfalls, nor is the adult material just a load of references or suggestive jokes. Instead the two are quite well blended with good physical comedy and plenty of wit. Again, it is the sense of spectacle and wonder that came through that I really appreciated.The animation feels more impressive for the reliance on mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects Â– in fact the computer effects look a bit dated now, even if they do still produce the goods in some key scenes. Mainly it is the feeling that every frame has had a lot of effort and love put into it that makes the whole affair feel classy. The songs are also great and feature quite a few memorable songs that stick in the mind; meanwhile the choreography of these scenes is generally very imaginative (Be Our Guest was my favourite). The cast don't feature many big stars and perhaps this is good because the real people don't distract from their characters. That said, I thought that Benson, O'Hara, White and a few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough for the film. Orbach, Stiers, Lansbury and others provided comic work in the support characters and everything worked well.Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1219029/,"This is Disney's greatest achievement. From the first shot of the castle right on to the end view of the stain glass window it is funny, frightening, and powerful. Every shot is even more enchanting and fantastic than the last. Walt Disney would be very proud of this film.Howard Ashman and Alan Menken have done what most composers can only dream of. To create a ""script"" in every lyric and every note that is heard. This film is nothing short of spectacular.Every voice is flawless. Robby Benson in particular reminds us all that you do not have to be in front of the camera to give off a believable and touching performance.The film is Oscar worthy in every way. The viewer would be well advised to bring a box of tissues during some of the films more tender moments. The ballroom scene is an example of how seamless the animation really is. Other tearjerker moments include a fight between Belle and The Beast which ends with the Beast leaving the protection of his castle to rescue the one who could break the spell from a pack of savagely monstrous wolves, the transformation of a monster into a man, and a dedication to the late Howard Ashman. You too will fall instantly under the spell of this beautiful story. If there is ever anything you will miss out on don't let this movie be it."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1313306/,"The first and possibly last animated movie to be nominated for best picture, and it should have won. This is an absolutely beautiful movie, and it makes me miss the art of hand drawn animation. Don't get me wrong Scilence of the Lambs was great movie and its really a tough choice but i think this one should have won. I hate to admit it but it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. If only Disney could get back to the likes of this film, and stop dicking around with the boring cgi movies. I hope someday we will see an animated movie win best picture, but sadly i think it will not happen, the only one in my opinion that came close was spirited away, and thats still no Beauty and the Beast."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1011895/,"This is a classic movie. We have breakthrough films like Snow White and Fantasia, and we have other greats like Aladdin and The Lion King, but this definitely tops them all. There is so much here that is missing in other Disney classics. This film has emotion, incredible music and animation, characters that you admire, laugh at, and despise. This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives. The way we can identify with the characters sucks us into the story. Don't miss this classic...the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1903333/,"Words fail me as I try to express my feelings about Beauty and the Beast, the best cartoon movie ever made! Praise is all that I can find for it and anything that I or any fan writes about it simply cannot do justice to this tour-de-force of top-class animation and elegant story-telling.Beauty and the Beast marks one of the first and best uses of digital animation for the range of human emotions that it captures. Even today, there is no sequence as memorable as the ballroom sequence where Belle and the Beast dance to the strains of the title tune. Speaking of tunes, no mention of this movie's artistic merits is ever complete without a mention of the songs. The lyrics written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are absolutely poetic (Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme) and the voicing of the songs by Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and others is simply incredible!The two best song sequences in the movie are 'Be My Guest' and 'Tale as old as time'. The script is excellent taking the old but fairly well-known fable and developing it into something modern yet touching and poignant. The new innovations of the scriptwriters to the original story such as putting a feminist touch on Belle, the development of the relationship between Belle and the Beast, the talking cutlery are fully fleshed out and have been integrated into the pace, moving the story forward and never slowing it down. The characters are sharply developed. Belle is a vibrant bookish girl who lives in a world of fairy tales, yet dearly loves her wacky but likable inventor father. Also it is worth mentioning that she is shown to have an individualistic bent of mind who sees the handsome but shallow Gaston for what he is and spurns his advances. She has the spunk to wear the type of clothes and act the way she wants unlike the other dumb village girls.At first she fears the Beast, but when he saves her she appreciates him and finds the prince within the Beast. She is intelligent, compassionate and has a mind of her own. She's also very outspoken and courageous as is evidenced by her opting to take her father's place in the Beast's castle and in her tirade of reason against the Beast when he rebukes her for putting herself into danger by trying to run away from the castle. With her strong personality, she makes a terrific role model for young girls everywhere. Long before Titanic, this was the first successful attempt at female empowerment. The Beast is a fierce ape-like creature whose short temper stems from his frustration at being unable to find true love. Gaston the narcissistic village champion who thinks that brawns are more important than brains is ridiculed by the movie and eventually exposed as its villain. Even minor supporting characters such as the clock, the lamp and the teapot are fleshed out and will enchant both kids and adults alike.I actually started crying during the movie's finale when the Beast dies after the struggle with Gaston and my sorrow was turned into joy when the curse is broken and the Beast gets transformed into a handsome prince. The transformation effects are simply mind-blowing (for a cartoon movie!).Some eighteen years after its release this movie only gets better with time. Cynics who normally dismiss cartoons and G-rated fare should see this movie and experience a change of heart. If this movie does not move them, then they should go admit themselves into a morgue!My Grade:A+!"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291289/,"This film, from it's opening narration, to the end credits, is a beautifully animated adaptation of a well known classic.When I first saw this, I was captivated by both the animation and the story. It's a nice tale, and as always, has something to teach us.
The songs are really great too. Every one in this movie, is beautifully sung and well orchestrated. Everyone knows the song ""Be our guest"" and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear/see it.The villain of the piece is of course Mr Universe with his bulging biceps and pearly white teeth, and we as an audience can't wait for the inevitable confrontation between him and the Beast.But to me, the real star of this film is Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury). She sings THAT song wonderfully, and sends a shiver down my back, and brings a tear to my eye every time!!This is, I must say, Disney at their best, they don't make them like this anymore, and it shows that when people care about something that they make, it'll all work out, and everyone will be happy ever after.10/10Enjoy!"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291358/,"This movie has been my favorite Disney movie since I was three years old. It is filled with humor, magic, suspense, and heart. It tells the story of a teenaged girl named Belle, whose father Maurice has been captured by a hideous beast, who is actually a selfish prince with a spell put on him. She makes a deal with the beast: The beast releases her father and takes her instead. She eventually warms his cold heart, and the two fall in love. But, a selfish man named Gaston, who has been in love with Belle, doesn't approve, and his plans almost prevail in an excellent climax. The title song ""Beauty and the Beast"" performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is classic. I would highly recommend this movie, even to adults, because it is sure to touch all who see it. 10/10."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1223955/,"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in my opinion, is a delightful Disney romance. If you ask me, Gaston (voice of Richard White) was truly diabolical. Still, in my opinion, he was very good-looking. On the other hand, the songs were truly superior. Well, despite the fact that every song in this film was good, I would have to say that the title song was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in delightful Disney romance to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291347/,"No other Disney movie in my oppinion, except for some of the classics from fifty years ago can compare to Beauty and the Beast. Disney hasn't made any good movies really in the past fifteen years except this. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Disey, Musicals, or movies at all. It is a true classic!!!!!!!!!!"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1272305/,"'' The Beauty and The Beast'' is one of the greatest stories ever told and one of the best movies from Disney that I watched in my life. I always identified myself with Belle, the girl who does not belong the place where she is lives and also with a big taste of reading lots of books. Our story takes part in France in 18 century, and our main character Belle is the prettiest girl in the city she lives, being the object of the affection and interest of Gaston, an arrogant man that has the sympathy of the people of the region.(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belle's father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner. He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father. She then makes a deal: Belle agrees to stay in the dark castle with the horrible beast in return to her father's freedom. But with the time, Belle is going to discover all the magic that is beyond the castle, including the talking objects and even a nice side that the Beast has.This story is very inspiring and very beautiful! =)"
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291321/,"I've not seen the newly added song sequence (Human Again) featured in the latest IMAX version so my comments are based entirely on the original theatrical and VHS release.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is Disney at its peak. From the stained glass window at the opening and the beautiful narration, the viewer is drawn into the story by the appealing music and clever lyrics (""Belle's Song"") which gets the picture off to a bouncy start. The opening sequence showing Belle and the townspeople in song is masterfully handled and choreographed for maximum effect, setting the tone for the entire story.The plot becomes thicker once Belle's father enters the castle grounds where the Beast resides. The castle interiors are brilliantly Baroque and the odd characters inhabiting the grounds are delightfully rendered by a perfect blending of art and voice talent. Cogsworth, Lumiere and Mrs. Potts are delightful creations, each with strong, consistent personalities. David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury cannot be praised enough for their contributions. Two of the musical highlights are Orbach's dazzling job on ""Be My Guest"" (with French accent) and Angela's tender rendering of the title song, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Unforgettable movie moments. As Gaston, Richard White's robust baritone voice adds greatly to the effectiveness of his villainy.It's no wonder the film was the first to receive recognition by the Academy with a Best Picture nomination. Outstanding in every department, including the end title song sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in a more ""modern"" style. Along with SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY, a top-notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults and children--as well as the child in all of us."
Beauty and the Beast,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6166189/,"... and be entertained with 90 minutes of mesmerising fairy tale telling at its very best. Feel as enchanted as the castle and its occupants as your spirits and emotions rise and fall then rise again. Rejoice in the spectacular finale, while relishing the craft of these incredible animators, musicians, writers, their genius and imagination but, above all, let the meaning and the message distil within you - avoid the shallowness of appearance, don't judge a book by its cover, we're all so much more than what we present."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342245/,"This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1244268/,"I watched the film today and I have come to the conclusion that this Disney film is one classic that will keep on delivering to Disney fans like myself...TLK is a wonderful film with great characters and songs with a powerful message that you can always find your way back no matter how hard the journey...I think The Lion King is one of the best Disney animated films matching with the power of Bambi and Brother Bear.I love how Disney Works hard to deliver the best in Animation,Song,And MagicI do believe that 2006 and many years from now The Lion King will Shine and still Roar with Success...Thank-You Disney For The Lion King"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1096039/,"I first saw The Lion King in 1994, when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have seen it at least 100 times. I have seen it at least that much because I watched it once every week for almost a year and a half.Recently, I became interested in it again, after having seen The Lion King 3 (or 1,5 if you prefer). It kind of surprised me how I was still intrigued and impressed by the whole thing. It was a magical experience that was almost as good as the very first time (I hadn't seen it in years).Everything about The Lion King is so good, that I can watch it over and over again, just like in the old days. The story begins light-hearted and it has a very nice and fun atmosphere. Very stereotypical characters, as always with Disney, but ever so unique in their own way. As the story progresses, it gets very serious, dramatic and sad as well, I actually cried when I saw it the first time (hey, I was 8, give me a break).Then two of the greatest characters in the history of Disney cartoons get introduced. Timon & Pumbaa set a new height considering comedy in cartoons. Again, very stereotypical, but unique in their own way (I loved Lion King 3 because of them).Another thing I absolutely love about this is the awesome music in it. When I was young I didn't pay attention to it as much as I do now, but the music adds so much to the whole movie.It was very obvious, even from just the intro alone, that Disney worked very hard on this masterpiece. I will definitely never forget The Lion King. I still watch it occasionally and I've never been bored.That's another thing I like about this: the songs. Every major Disney picture has a few songs in it and most of the time they are very memorable. It's the same story here, the songs are very memorable and overall just brilliant. ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can't Wait to be King"" will always have a special place in my heart.I knew the entire script of the Dutch dubbed version when I was young, having seen it so many times. Kind of pathetic, I know, but I liked it that much. Still do.The King among Disney Cartoons for me."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1218627/,"I think think this film is excellent and nothing can ever relate to it. I will love this movie my whole life i know i will!! Its great :) The music, the sounds, the characters,the whole movie is great. Its definitely great for kids and it always will be this movie will never grow old. People will still like it when they are 60+. I bet there are people sixty and over who do love this movie.. I am glad that i grew up with this movie its great and i just have to say fare play to the directer i love it!!! I am happy i found this sight i think it is great it give the public a chance to see how there favorite movie is rated by people all over the world. And i think it is excellent the public is aloud to vote!"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476882/,"A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3755877/,"""The best movie I ever watched in any form or any in language"".No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge ""The Best Ever"" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata!"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342202/,"Delightful animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures about a naive young lion cub destined for greatness. Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years laterâ€”as an adultâ€”he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5008960/,"Watched the new one, and I think I had a disgusted look on my face the entire time. The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342377/,"Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula sceneÂ… ""Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy!Â… Ahhhh!"", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342198/,"The Lion King is absolutely Disney's greatest achievement to date and will long be hailed as such. The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice. If you aren't among the millions that have purchased the video DO IT (if you can find it anywhere)!"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227005/,"This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5011179/,"Best animated of all time! That's it, that's the review!"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2726640/,"Hakuna Matata, the catchphrase that this movie made many say for years, the movie is full of action and fun, that has made it one of the best 2D animation one could see, the movie dialogue is also intriguing and funny, the movie which seems to be in three parts, the first being Simba's life in Pride rock, his life with Timon and Pumbaa where he loses some of his Lion instincts and the last part where he goes back to Pride rock to reclaim his throne. The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be a total original story, all other animations before it have been based on an already existing work. The idea of the movie was conceived during the promotion of Oliver & Company, the idea was basic: a story about animals that will be set in Africa. The filmmakers, then went ahead to build the story taking ideas from the lives of Joseph and Moses (from the Bible) and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.The movie production began during the time of the production of Pocahontas, many of the animators and directors at Disney felt that not many people will want to sit and watch a little Lion cub who is framed for murder (murder of his father) by his uncle, for that reason alone many of the animators wanted to work on Pocahontas instead, but to their surprise although both were financially successful, Lion King made more money (it has become the highest grossing 2D animation ever) and received more positive reviews.The voice casting for Lion King, was full of stars from Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg (just to mention a few) and even Disney's long time voice artist Jim Cummings was also available in this unending list of star voice actors.The movie plot of Lion king is about a lion cub named Simba who gets framed for murdering his father (Mufasa voiced by James Earl Jones) by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Simba runs away from his right as heir to the throne and meets and befriends a meerkat, Timon (Nathan Lane) and a warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella). Things were going well but the past that Simba ran from found him where he was hiding and now Simba (Matthew Broderick) has to go back to Pride Rock to face his past.Lion King is a nice animation to own and watch again. Two home video sequels were done of the movie, The Lion King 2 (not worth watching at all) and The Lion King 11/2 (good enough to be seen), and a series about Timon and Pumbaa was also done, which was amusing.www.lagsreviews.com"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3871529/,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? On every level, it is perfect until Simba is exiled, then I believe the film devolves only slighting. The character development, plot, humor, and animation are all on point. I only issue, which is small, is the predictability of the plot after Simba leaves, destined to return. The message is clear and good: Do not forget who you are/where you came from. 9/10 (almost perfect)"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2865430/,"That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342309/,"Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs by Elton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so). As he grows up, he goes on a journey of love, friendship and discovery which will lead him back to his rightful place in the world. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3787202/,"this was, and still is,a great movie I love it, and hope that everyone gets to experience it for themselves, I've watched it many times and it is always good no matter how many times you have seen it,the songs are great and so are all the characters and the story is incredible, great for all ages and I really recommend it to anyone who hasn't already watched it."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342337/,"Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1131960/,"Ah...""The Lion King."" There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. ""The Lion King"" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though ""The Morning Report"" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. ""The Lion King"" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. ""The Lion King"" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! ""The Lion King"" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1077708/,"The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342205/,"This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10"
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1441890/,"I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2109086/,"Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.""The Lion King"" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, ""The Circle of Life,"" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that ""The Lion King"" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Lion King."" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. ""The Lion King"" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, ""The Circle of Life"" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.""The Lion King"" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why ""The Lion King"" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see ""The Lion King."" You won't be disappointed."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2235557/,"Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction."
The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342243/,"The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++"
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1259940/,"I have a 4.5 year old daughter who is going through the princess phase. We read lots of fairy tales etc and its very difficult to find a fairy tale where the princess is strong and resourceful. Most of the time they are pretty passive and the worst one is sleeping beauty. I find myself treading a fine line between letting her enjoy the fairy tale and occasionally commenting on the fact that perhaps some of these princesses just don't do enough to help themselves and how they can help themselves a little bit more. I don't want to destroy her pleasure in these fairy tales, after all, I loved them too. But it took me a while as adult to see how the subconscious message of helplessness in these fairy tales can reinforce the existing values of society and parents that girls are meant to be saved. So it is a great pleasure to be able to show my daughter a story of a strong and intelligent girl - Mu Lan and its great that Mu Lan and we are both ethnically Chinese. Here is a heroine who is resourceful, uses her brains, saves the Captain and China. We draw many discussion points from the story, such as why it is that women were not allowed to join the army, the value of trying hard and training and practising hard, what is discipline and why it is needed to succeed, using your brains and thinking of how to solve a problem, not just using brute strength, etc. Even some politics - like why did the Hun king want the Emperor to bow to him and why the Emperor wouldn't bow to him but would bow to Mulan. My challenge is the explain things in a way which is both accurate and yet understandable to a 4 year old. My daughter loves the story because Mulan does a lot of ""saving"". My daughter has probably watch the movie only 3 times coz I limit TV and video a lot. But she'll ask me to tell her the story in my own words, based on the video. It works out great.The fact that the movie Mulan captivates me as an adult also helps. There's only so much I can enjoy of a barney video. I definitely recommend this movie to parents with young girls, as a good place to start talking about being a strong and intelligent woman. Another good one is Beauty and the Beast. I've not seen Pocahontas so I can't comment on that."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1645476/,"A great story..I have always been impressed by China's history,by its culture..even though this film is fiction but even so..I like it!..A girl,Mulan,who wants to save his father from going to war and die in battle...a little dragon,Mushu,who tries to convince the ancestors of the Fa family that he can do something important without messing up things around him..a bug who thinks he's lucky and it seems that he really has lot of luck..and a brave horse and companion,Khan..they all decide to help Mulan in war..that's the plot of the story...In the end everything turns out OK and Shang and Mulan fall in love.. I recommend this movie to everyone..and I hope you'll like it as much as I did..or who knows?even more.."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1271496/,"One of the reasons why I like Mulan so much, is because she is independent and braver than many of the female characters from Disney, who looks always to be searching for a man to be the reason for them to live or to be happy. Mulan is lovely, but also a tomboy what always gives her problems. Since the story takes place in a China of more than 1.000 years ago, women from that time, more than in the present days, needed to have an outstanding behavior all the time and with everybody.Being the only kid her parents had in a time where women didn't have many rights,Mulan is pressed to marry with a good catch. One day, she is going to see the matchmaker but everything goes wrong,since she is clumsy and not very graceful. Being accused that she '' will never bring honor to her family'', Mulan stays sad and depressed, and so stays her parents. But the chance to change that awful prophecy comes quick when the Emperor's men started to call one man from every family to serve in the Imperial Army: since Mulan's father was no longer young and healthy, Mulan reported to the army with a new name and looks. But she needed to make this a secret, because it was against the Chinese laws to a woman be a soldier, so, with the help of the dragon of the family called Mushu,one of the coolest adventures from Disney's starts."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1837880/,"Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney's mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number ""reflection"" that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I'm a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about Disney's mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn't completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!"
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1671328/,"In the 1990s, I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin. Unlike most of the world, I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments. Sure, POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch, but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey. And as for HUNCHBACK, the story was so dark and unappealing, I have no idea WHO the intended audience was. So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN. Instead, it seemed fresh, well-made, humorous and fun--something distinctly missing from these other films. While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic, for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464674/,"Mulan is a tomboy of sorts - not something that is looked for in a Chinese wife, and she causes constant worry and dishonour to her family.  When the Huns attack China, the Emperor commands each family to put one man forward to fight.  With Mulan's aged father the only man of the family it looks like he must fight, but Mulan dresses as a man and takes his place.  With the help of dragon Mushu, Mulan overcomes her status as a woman to help take on the Hun.I wasn't sure I would like this film as I have grown a little tired of the Disney formula of `songs, romance and smartassed comedy sidekicks', which Mulan sticks to pretty well, however I did really enjoy this film.  I think it was mainly because of the sweep of the story, the big battles and the majestic feel to the movie.  The plot moves swiftly and felt like it was all over too quickly.  It has the usual mix of laughs for parents and kids as well as having quite a good story behind it all.The only major weakness is the songs.  I didn't exactly start tapping my feet at any of them and, while they are not bad per se, they aren't great and after a few lines I was wanting to skip past them (but couldn't - it was showing on TV).  Asides from these the film is funny and quite dramatic and is good fun to watch.  The cast are good.  Ming-Na is a good Mulan while Murphy rehearses for Shrek with his smart mouthed dragon that gets plenty of good laughs.  DB Wong is a good actor but has a `straight' role and doesn't distinguish himself.  I was worried at first by the presence of Harvey Fierstein, but he did good work and wasn't half as irritating as he usually is.With colourful animation that is good without being Pixar, this is a good cartoon that is fun, funny and, at times, dramatic.  I'm not a big fan of Disney over the last few years but I did really enjoy this film and would watch it again."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1211446/,"""Mulan"" is not quite a chick flick and it's much better than ""Pochantas."" It has terrific animation and I forgot I was even watching animation. The script has some funny lines. The music is not great (the writers didn't ring any bells with me as to their past work) but good lyrics. I was disappointed that the music wasn't as Asianish as ""Lion King"" is Africanish. And the final rap is a bit off-putting, though the segue into the Stevie Wonder song was fun.Eddie Murray isn't Robin Williams but he's fun. At least they do use quite a few Asian actors' voices - Wing Na Wen (""E.R.""), George Takei (""Star Trek""), B.D. Wong (""Oz"") Pat Morita (""Karate Kid""). I think ""Mulan"" is the first Disney animation post-Katzenberg and there's a couple of digs at him and responses to the criticisms of how he did the girl stars. There was a lot of criticism of how Katzenberg personally insisted on Jasmine in ""Aladdin""s impossible Barbie shape and ""Mulan"" takes that on with a line about how stupid it is to want such a narrow waist. Definitely a much more positive body image movie than under the Katzenberg regime. There's no dead mother syndrome here, well for Mulan anyway. The Captain's mother isn't mentioned. Not only is there a mom, but even a grandmom. The father is still Freudian - he's wounded. All the Disney dads of daughters have some incapacity or other or tragic flaw.Refreshingly, there's no wedding at the end with birds chirping as a canopy. The courting is assumed and the grandmom invites the captain to live there forever--but Mulan shuts her up. (originally written 7/23/1998)"
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1093000/,"There are too few ""girl"" heroes in stories. According to Chinese legend, Mulan, the only child of an aging soldier, disguised herself as a male to take her sickly father's place fighting evil invaders. While in the disguise of a loyal soldier to the emperor, Mulan falls in love with her commander, who does not suspect the deception. When Mulan saves the entire fighting forces, what she managed to hide up to that point is discovered: She is a girl masquerading as a man. Rather than punish Mulan with death, the commander sends her away (presumably to die). In the end Mulan is honored with a medal for bravery by the Emperor himself. Although ""only"" a female, she had saved the entire empire from certain doom.The finest moment is the scene where her father says ""I am proud to call you daughter"". Legend or history, this is a fine example of telling a story centering around a girl, rather than the countless tales celebrating boys as heroes. Like so many other recent animated Disney features, this is yet another gem in the treasure chest of Walt Disney Studios."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1065328/,"I know this sounds silly, but Mulan is actually my all-time favorite movie. Trust me, I am a perfectly intelligent young woman who likes to read and is going to college, but there's just something about Mulan that I have always loved. It suffered a lot in release because it was lost in an avalanche of new CGI movies like A Bug's Life. But Mulan's story is every bit as good as those movies, even if you find the animation less impressive.The strengths of the movie for me are not the songs (which are very weak compared to earlier Disney), nor the animation (which is charming with a few Chinese flourishes) or any other technical aspect of the movie production. What makes this moving great is that it has a truly endearing, likable main character. While in most Disney movies the silly sidekicks or cute animals steal the show, in this movie Mulan is both funny and brave, making her a truly human character that I rooted for whole-heartedly.I am also a crazy feminist and for me this movie is the ultimate girl-power movie. Who would of thought that could ever be said of a Disney movie? But really, Mulan, as a Chinese tomboy who never quite feels that she fits in in her society, is an excellent picture of a woman finally proving to the world that she can do everything a man can do. After watching the movie (which I have done over 15 times) I always feel really inspired and motivated! Seriously! The movie without a doubt has lots of production problems (bad songs, clichÃ©d side-characters, mediocre villain), but I still highly, highly recommend because fundamentally the characters are likable and believable and the plot is well constructed. Oh and I think it's pretty damn funny. Mushu always makes me laugh, and watching Mulan try to spit is still the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.If you want the classic singing, dancing fairy tale-style Disney movies a la The Little Mermaid, this is not quite what you're looking for. Mulan is more character driven and less lavishly made. But it absolutely belongs in the upper ranks of Disney, and it's a pity that Disney couldn't have continued to make animated features of this quality."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464649/,"Mulan is a young girl in ancient China. When the Huns start attacking the country, the Emperor orders one member of every family to join the Chinese Army and defend the country. The one member must be a man, but in Mulan's family, the only male is her injured father. Not wanting to allow her father to die, Mulan dresses like a man, and escapes into the night to join the war. To protect her, the ancient elders of her family ask the great Stone Dragon to watch over her. Unfortunately, the great Stone Dragon is destroyed by the little tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy). So with Mushu and a small cricket by her side, Mulan heads off to help destroy the Huns.
I think we can all guess what happens. Mulan, although a woman, manages to save the day. The plot line isn't really a surprise when you break it down. And the animation is, by now, expected to be great, and Mulan certainly lives up to the great Disney tradition. It's the story and the feeling you get that makes this movie so wonderful. Disney went through a lot to make sure it's depiction of ancient China was accurate. From the decorations on the walls, to the matchmakers, to the great honor in family, Disney manages to show what the country of China was like, and in many ways, still is today. Following the Disney tradition, there is a strong female character, this time taking lead. There are the over the top bad guys, and of course, the comic relief. Eddie Murphy was just down right hilarious in this movie. I wish they had showed more of him. The songs were sort of a change of pace, with Matthew Wilder and Jerry Goldsmith doing the honors, and not the venerable Alan Menken. The music was good, but the lyrics in some of the songs were weak. The reason I feel Mulan was better than recent Disney fare like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame is because it had a much more lively feel to it. Hercules was very dark, animation-wise. Everything was centered on the color blue, so it didn't feel alive. And The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a more adult story, and some of the scenes were very dark and broody. Mulan took a simple plot, put it in ancient China, and made it very colorful and fun to watch. It was light, and ""Disney"" enough for kids to enjoy, while still being adult enough for the parents to enjoy. Overall, I'd say Mulan is definitely one to watch. Disney animation has done it again."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464558/,"There are two things I love about this movie, aside from its stunning and beautiful animation.  One is that I love the fact that Disney is exploring legends from other cultures and I am so glad it brought us this one.  The other is that I just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  I loved Mulan's character.  She was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.  I was thrilled to see the portrayal of a strong female character surviving because of her own integrity and strength rather than because of her looks.  Bravo, Disney, for bringing us this wonderfully progressive Chinese tale."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464662/,"I can't think of a single animated feature film done by Disney that I don't like. For some reason they never bore me and they never feel the same. The classics like 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella' are great but I think I like the newer ones ('The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'The Lion King') even more. 'Mulan' definitely belongs to the best ones.Mulan is a girl who doesn't do much right. For the honor of her family she joins the army instead of her father. She takes his gear and runs off. She pretends to be a man and does the training to go to war against the Huns who invaded China.With some nice new songs, great music by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful animations this is a real Disney. A little dragon called Mushu is helping her on the way. He is send by the ancestors. The voice of Mushu is from Eddie Murphy and he does a very great job. With a quick and good story and a lot of funny moments this is a great movie."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1383082/,"Now, I'm sixteen and I still watch Disney movies more than any other type of movies out there, so some people consider me pretty childish. I don't know if that'll hurt my opinion on this film or not, but I'm giving my opinion anyways.Mulan is probably one of the best Disney movies of all time. It, along with the Lion King and the Lion King II are probably the only movies I can watch more than once in a day. And yes, I have watched Mulan more than once in a day. And I've rewound (it's VHS. I still live in the '90s. Get over it) some parts over and over during those viewings. This movie is just so fantastic I can hardly put it into words. The music isn't tiresome or annoying like some Disney movies, the message is strong and a good one, and there are some dark elements in it that won't scare the children but will provide a little extra entertainment for adults.I personally think that this movie should be in every household - whether there are children or teenagers or adults watching, it's fantastic."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5966248/,"Mulan is an entertaining tale of a young girl who takes her father's place in the Chinese army. I think what I appreciate most about this film is that they don't spend a massive amount of time on her possibly being discovered. There's one scene that creates that kind of tension, but otherwise she remains hidden until the movie is ready for her to be revealed. The rest of the time she's just treated like any other soldier who is trying their best to become an effective warrior in the battle against the Huns. I like the training sequences, I find the other soldiers that she meets to be charming, and I'm always a sucker for those scenes when the instructor presents a seemingly impossible task and our protagonist figures out how to make it happen. The film manages to condense the war down to a single moment, but I thought it was a surprisingly effective way of making our heroine a savior on such a grand scale that it allows people to ignore centuries of tradition that minimize the role of women.Where I think Mulan suffers to some degree is that the creators felt beholden to the Disney animated tropes. The small cricket and dragon are not important to the plot and mostly provide slapstick comedy breaks. I'm all for Eddie Murphy being silly in an animated film, but the tone of Mulan feels less suited to his antics. In fact, I suspect the live action remake of this film will be one of the best because they will probably excise Mushu and Cri-kee from the script. The musical numbers are good songs, but they also feel a bit unnecessary in this story. I wouldn't say they bothered me, because the tunes are catchy, but I didn't think they needed to be there. My only other complaint about Mulan would be that the entire film feels a bit rushed. This might also be based on the fact that they were trying to meet some Disney animated movie standards, and keep it under 90 minutes for the young kids. I just felt they could have used a little more time to let some aspects of the story breathe and develop some of the characters a bit more. However, Mulan works quite well as a film, and it also looks great. This is definitely one of Walt Disney Animation Studios' successes."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1526320/,"I really held back from Disney's later animated features, most of them started to slid down hill after The Lion King, excluding The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but it seemed like Mulan was going to be a disappointment for Disney. It turned out to be an actual pleasure watching this film. It had great animation, a good soundtrack, and a wonderful story about courage and strength.Mulan is a girl in China who is ready for marriage but seems like she isn't ready to settle down in this man's world where she must have permission to speak and only cook and please her husband. When her father is called to war, she fears for his life and dresses like him and fights in his place disguised as him. Mushu, her ""guardian"" dragon per say, comes to help her out and make sure she doesn't get herself killed out there in battle. She also falls for the captain that doesn't kill her when he finds out her secret.It is a visually stunning masterpiece that I am glad that I had a chance to watch. It had great morals and values for children, even if it was a bit unrealistic, we have to let go. Still, I don't think a film will compare yet to The Lion King or Beauty and The Beast, but Mulan is a treasure of it's own.7/10"
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464632/,"Definitely one of my favourite Disney movies ever.  It's always nice to see a female come to the rescue.  And after Hercules, I'm glad that the villains in this movie were actually scary.  A chill went down my spine during the mountain scene.  And the ending was great too, not completely wrapping up the story like most Disney movies do.  Excellent work."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1411229/,"I first saw this movie as a little kid, but I still enjoy it now that i'm 15. I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.""It's racist!"" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.""It's discriminating against men!"" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.""It's too violent!"" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1046856/,"Mulan is my favorite animated movie. This is a true Disney gem that a person of any age will enjoy. Disney has truly outdone itself this time, it's too bad that Disney doesn't make traditional musical films like this anymore. It has a good storyline that keeps the audience interested. The backdrops are wonderfully drawn. The songs are memorable and entertaining, plus they're sung by two very good singers: Lea Salonga and Donnie Osmond. I'm so glad they got Jerry Goldsmith to score this movie. It's music is definitely its best asset (with an academy award nomination at its belt). No animated movie has spent so much time on my cd player and on my VHS set. This cartoon is truly worth watching."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2780018/,"By Disney renaissance standards, this was pretty close to what the film was actually based on, the ancient Chinese poem called the Ballad of Hua Mulan. There is a slight exception from the poem and the movie, in the fact, that she lasted ten to 12 years in the military without getting discovered. Disney got it wrong in the settling as well, the ballad is set in the Northern-Southern dynasties period (420 to 589 AD), but Mulan the film makes it look like the height of the Ming dynasty a thousand years later. Oh, she also died tragically in the ballad. She commits suicide because the emperor asked her to be a concubine. But that's beside the point. I'm just history nerding. In the end, the story is the same, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) must pretend to be a man to save her elderly father from death in the army due to invasion with the Huns and it's leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). Some people think of him as forgettable due to one of the relatively few Disney villains who doesn't have a villain song, but I like Shan Yu as a villain because he looks so scary. No, his personality isn't that great, but the dude just looks like a monster! And he's a powerhouse! He can slice through the castle pillars with one swing of his sword. He's the only Disney villain I can think of that actually causes that kind of destruction. He doesn't need to be fleshed out as a character. He's the leader of the Hun Army. The Huns were trying to conquer China and were really violent and underhanded in their tactics. He belongs with the greats. One thing that bugs me in the film is how Mulan go to the camp, and get nearly kicked out of the army for not being fit, which kinda negates, the whole point of her taking her father's place. Clearly, her father wasn't healthy so if he was sent instead of her, he would have been sent home anyways. So what was the point of replacing him? Why, didn't Mulan go home after not being fit to join the army? I think it's about giving Honor to the family. Mulan's smart in a way I can see, a cheater, a bit lazy, loving, outspoken, and just fails at all things social, but lovable. This 'wood orchid' seems like the girl-power type character for the overly feminist. If anything, I've always seen her as a person who was just trying to find her own place regardless of gender roles. She tries to act as her society's definition of a woman and fails, she tries to act as her society's definition of a man and fails. If anything, Mulan only succeeds when she acts like herself rather than the roles that are put before her. It isn't about the girl power or the male dominance, it's about people finding their own place in life. Mulan may be a strong female character, but I don't believe with Disney marketing her as a princess. Mulan appealed to some girls because she wasn't a princess. The title of Princess is really just more marketable, because Queens in Disney type movies are usually evil, while the Princess is a heroine. Still, Mulan is not a princess. For example, Mulan in the movie didn't like her kimono outfit and found it uncomfortable and it's only seen in the beginning of the film. And yet, most of the toys of her showed her in that outfit as opposed to her warrior one. For Disney to do that is kinda wrong. A lot of the hate has to do with gender roles. No matter how brave or action oriented or tomboyish princesses are, they still dress in pretty clothes and have beautiful hair and fall in love which isn't realism to the source material. The main musical theme ""Reflections"" is well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion. Even though it's like the other princess songs, it's still a great song. 'A girl worth fighting for' is just as good, but my favorite is 'Be a man'. Most badass song in Disney history. How come only guys can have no singing ability whatsoever but still make an awesome song? Was it really necessary for Shang to be shirtless for the entire duration of that song? Shang clearly had a thing for Mulan even during the time he didn't know she was indeed a she. Conclusion, Shang must be at least bi. Disney, you astonished me again. Want to know something interesting though, the voice actor for Captain Li Shang, was B.D. Wong, an actually an openly gay man in real life. So it was a bit odd in a while. The confusing gender roles jokes and visual gags closely border on PG, but it was funny. Another person who was funny was Eddie Murphy as Mushu, the Chinese Dragon. He did OK in the role, but couldn't they find a Chinese or Asian American comedian, that would fit the film, more. I don't mind the fact that the Chinese culture is underplayed. Speaking as an Asian, it's refreshing to see a work of media that takes place in an Asian setting without overplaying the stereotypes to the point of offensiveness. The film was generally well received by Chinese audiences. The fact that Jackie Chan put his pipes to work as the voice of the captain for the Mandarin dub didn't hurt either. The animation was breathtaking in some scenes, but others were missing the epic sheer artistry. All in all the film itself doesn't really do any harm to the source material or the culture it seeks to portray. I really liked that about it and continue to consider it one of Disney's better animated films of recent memory."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5906001/,"Under the idea of Disney, Hua Mulan's story is blooming again. A woman out of the world and their own shackles, for the family and the country to fight hard to win their own wonderful life."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0953845/,"I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons, too many to list here, but I will go on the record as saying that Mulan has got to be one of the best Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.Mulan sticks out in my mind for this reason. For once, we have a strong female lead, or at the least, stronger than most of them. She isn't counted among the Disney ""princesses"" line-up. She doesn't want for herself, and she seeks to look deeper within herself to discover her inner being. She isn't like Ariel, who wants to be someone else. She isn't like Jasmine, who sits in luxury, waiting to be swept off her feet by Prince Charming, just like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and almost any female character that Disney brings to life. And while she does share some traits among this list, she stands out because she does something that these do not. She uses her mind. Mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads. Mulan is a thinker, and a do-er. She's resourceful, like Aladdin. She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.) And she sacrifices herself for the sake of others, like Hercules. She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing. She doesn't waste time pining about ""will I ever find true love?"" Indeed, we see that she has an attraction to Shang (as he was her husband in the legends,) but we see her uncomfortable and unsure of meeting the Match-maker. She begs for her father's life when Chi-Fu came to the village. When you see her make her decision to take her father's place in the army, she does so out of her love for him, valuing his life above hers. She doesn't wish to become a man to see what it is like or for a change. Only to save his life. She later doubts herself and her reasons for going, but she did so because of her inner strengths, something other female Disney leads too often lack. (And it is these strengths that Shang is attracted to at the end.)This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu. Though not as memorable as Jafar or Ursula, he is more effective and more menacing because he is not fantastic. By that, I mean that he is not magical, he holds no special power. He is portrayed as a man, and as a man that could have truly existed, performing vicious acts that men do. We see the destruction that his army lays to a village, and when Mulan finds the doll, it shows that Shan Yu left no one living, man, woman or child. This is what makes him so effective as a villain, showing how truly human he indeed is. Granted, the producers did not develop him in any great depth, but they showed enough of him to remind us of his threat to China. Besides, sometimes the better villains are the ones you don't know too much about, or see a lot of.Of the rest of the supporting cast, I will only mention four of them as being memorable in any real way. Chi-Fu, the emperor's consultant, was a reminder of the way many men looked at women in this culture. He thrusts his head up when Mulan begs for her father's life, and when she is discovered to be a woman, though she is a hero, he is quick to insult her, and to order her execution, simply because she impersonated a man. The other three were, of course, her comrades, Ling, Yao, and Chian Po. Though they were mainly comic relief (almost like a 3 stooges set,) they remained loyal to Mulan and trusted her fully, even after she was discovered. I like them, because they were not discriminatory to her in any way, even trying to stop her execution. When Mulan told them she had an idea to help the emperor faster, they were the first to her side, even when Shang was still reluctant to do so.Overall, a wonderful movie to the Disney list. If you haven't seen it, then do so, you won't regret it.And yes, Mushu was a cool character as well.**** In Response to an earlier post by Phoenix-1 **** To expect any movie to accurately portray history in any way is lunacy. Even those movies that come close to historical accuracy are flawed in many ways. This was a way of telling a story, as any movie is. It can be argued that it tries to provoke curiosity in another culture, but it is also meant to entertain. I would also like to point out that Mulan is really not ""historical,"" like Joan of Arc, but rather she is a legend, much like Hercules and Aladdin, who also come from the realm of myth, stories and legends. And while there is some difference between the original legend and this movie, your examples of how Disney would butcher tales of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln do not compare to this story in any way. Your arguments for comparison should be better applied to Pocahontas, as she was an actual historical figure."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464626/,"Ok... I've read through most of the posted comments posted before this about this movie; I find that some people love the music, but think the characters are thin; some hate Eddie Murphy's presence, and think the love story is stupid. Well, your experience with a film is individual, I guess.That said, I'll follow the trail and state why I loved watching this movie not once, but several times:First of all, I'm far from being a fan of animated Disney classics. I'm in that age between child and adult(currently 23), where everything is a rebelry. Most of my viewing pleasures is action or its like.My original incentive for seeing this movie was to please a friend of mine, who has a long-life fascination for oriental culture (read: karate films!). When Mulan was released in Denmark, a single copy with the original voices track (usually all animated Disneys are dubbed into danish with good result) was shown in a local theater. Asking a couple of girls out, we went and saw it. Ok, I was blown away. Before I had left the cinema that day, I too was captured by chinese history and culture. The singing and music I was prepared for; I knew The Jungle Book and Aristocats from childhood. The songs didn't mean anything to me, other than that they were few - good for me. (Some of them do kling to the ear - irritating for me!) I quickly realised Eddie Murphy was on the voices cast. I started liking the movie right then. Some find him malplaced in a Disney epic, but fact is that the business of animating classics is profiting well these years in bringing in already established names to the animations; Tom Hanks in the Toy Stories, Mel Gibson in Pocahontas, Robin Williams in Aladdin, and who else I don't know of. These names sell the film before the film have a chance to sell itself. (The danish producers, by the way, have stolen this idea when dubbing the films, using local media stars for the voice cast.) Well...it did work for me. Eddie Murphy is not as funny in this production as he is in others, but what the heck...he can't exactly use too much harsh language, it IS a children's flick. But with the room he got, his speedy tongue made me laugh again and again. I have later seen Aladdin, and find Eddie Murphy's achievement as funny as Robin Williams'. That Eddie Murphy chose this project was an interesting and probably very clever career move. Later, when I studied the rest of the cast list, I noticed a lot of chinese names. That very much pleased me. Who other than Chinese people to tell a Chinese tale to Westerners? I found some old friends, Soon-Tek Oh and James Hong, people who had worked with Chick Norris in the 80's. Pat Morita as the emperor made me smile. B.D.Wong I remembered from Jurrasic Park, but Ming-Na was new to me (had to look her up in IMDB, was stunned not to have known her before (Ok, I went wow!)). Harvey Fierstein as a ploppy little soldier and Miguel Ferrer as the Hun leader I found the perfect voice-choice for their characters...other names rang also. Anyway, a lot of the above have only value after you've seen the film. When you are an Atlantic ocean from most of the sales pitch, the film had to sell itself. It did - for me, anyway. Before then, I knew little about China and her history apart from things here and there (read: karate films!). Meeting angient China like this totally threw me away. Wership of the ancestors, the power and position of the emperor, I found myself lost in the dream of a world long gone; I loved the image of a China with different traditions but still found myself attracted to the pro-Disney story about a girl standing up to a culture's sexist prejudice. (I do find the plot a bit silly, actually, but I let myself be taken away...it's just a Disney.) Agree, the characters lack a little bit, the love story of Mulan and Shang should perhaps have had a few more frames to play with. The project was a little bit tuned down from the Disney board of directors, but honor to all who worked with it: You people did a good job! The computer animation used for the Great Wall and the attack of the Huns startles me again and again; Not many live movies can do the job as good.So that's what Mulan is for me...The dream of ancient China and Eddie Murphy's speedy tongue. I accept the term classic. I have the damn thing on video now (English language) and must prevent myself from seeing it too often, in fright of one day getting tired of it."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464612/,"Now I must admit I wasn't sure about this one. MULAN seemed to break most of my preconceived rules on Disney movies. These included the fairytale element - a cross-dressing Chinese soldier doesn't have the same magical appeal as, say, the son of the Greek gods searching for his birthright, etc etc. Also, this verge towards realism meant that the bad guy would not be as appealing - Disney villains are camp, over-the-top thespians by rule - Jeremy Irons in THE LION KING for example. I was concerned about the absence of king-of-melody composer Alan Menken, whose wonderful songs encapsulate the charm of Disney.However, that said, I thought this film was wonderful. The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn. Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan's songs) is worth the price of this film alone. Eddie Murphy has managed to be as good, if not better, than Robin Williams as the comic sidekick. And the film's conclusion is as genuine and as heartfelt as any adaptation of this story. The mountain scene contains some of the best animation I have seen from Disney, and the rousing score from maestro Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action superbly.This may not turn out to be a classic in the same way as THE LION KING and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but I enjoyed it immensely. Go see it now!!!"
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1172430/,"Words just cannot express the beauty in this film. Mulan, our heroine, is a sweet, yet awkward young woman who wishes to bring honor to her also-loving family.After a meeting with the matchmaker goes horribly awry, Mulan is left ashamed and distraught. She wishes so badly to please and bring honor to her family, yet her spunky, outspoken attitude makes this a struggle for her in a culture where women are expected to be quiet and subservient. But despite her failure, her family still loves her.That very day, the Emperor's consul comes with a declaration: one man from every family is to serve in the Emperor's army in the war against the Huns. Mulan, knowing that her father will certainly be killed if he goes to war, disguises herself as a man and goes to war in his place. The sentiment and unconditional love portrayed in this movie makes it a very beautiful story.The movie also pokes some good-natured fun at males in general, but never to a ridiculous degree. The one reference to a modern media (Batman) is subtle enough that it doesn't spoil the atmosphere. Mushu sometimes feels a little overdone, but isn't too bad overall. There's enough comic relief in the movie to keep it fun.Another thing going for this film is that the dilemmas faced by the characters are very, very serious. The villain isn't just set out to conquer; he's set out to slaughter. This is made very clear to the audience - and although it was kept toned down, it wasn't completely sugarcoated, either.Also, I feel that Mulan is a much better role-model for girls than certain other animated characters. The love and respect that she shows for her family (especially for her father) is a breath of fresh air compared to many other animated female leads."
Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0464673/,"Witty, amusing little Disney movie, regardless of the horrid song element.I'm not a fan of the Disney musical formula. I do not like the made-for-five-year-old song element found in most Disney animations, so I tend to just ignore those sections except in movies such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" where that activity is just not possible. I therefore avoid the movie itself, as often as I can.This movie, has much of that Disney musical element, which for me, lowers the value of the movie.However, the animation is far better than that of other later Disney movies, and the backgrounds are well done, which is a delightful surprise.Disney has taken to ignoring detail, of late, which is a major disappointment for those of us who watch these movies for the animation quality.The story itself is really very compelling, innovative, and strong. I thoroughly enjoyed this Disney attempt, although I am sure, as with all Disney sequels, they will screw up the animation quality and background value in Mulan 2. And I fully appreciated the comedic element provided by Eddie Murphy.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :."
